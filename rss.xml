&lt;p&gt;Fans of different programming languages always argue about benefits of their language
of choice. It is difficult to use objective criteria in a debate like this. Terms like 
'clarity' or 'maintainability' are too vague and subjective. What if we used some tools from network 
science to compare projects written in different languages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I use network analysis to investigate how complex dependency graphs are and
if they differ between C# and F#.
It turns out that F# and C# 
dependency networks have quite different structures and use 
different local network patterns.
For example, I'll describe specific types of cyclic dependencies 
that frequently appear only in C# projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Who's the most central? F# network on Twitter</title>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered who you should follow on Twitter to get more interesting
F# content? 
Recently I've written a chapter on social network analysis for the new 
&lt;a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek2/"&gt;F# Deep Dives&lt;/a&gt; book. The chapter shows
how to download data on social connections from Twitter and how to do some
exploratory data analysis, such as finding accounts that people
find worth following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with a network around the 
&lt;a href="http://fsharp.org"&gt;F# Software Foundation's&lt;/a&gt; account. What
emerged is a nice picture of how F# community looks on Twitter and which 
users are the most central to the network. 
Since the results are quite interesting, I'd like to share them with wider F# community.
&lt;/div&gt;
